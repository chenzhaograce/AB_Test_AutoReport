# AB Test Post-test Report 

## Test Parameters 
Minimum Detectable Effect: 0.1
AB Test significance Level: 0.05
Power: 0.8

## Test Data 
Number of rows: 139922, Number of columns: 5
Test data columns: ['impression_id' 'date' 'experiment' 'group' 'converted']
Conversion metric: converted
Start date: 2023-07-01, End date: 2023-07-14, Duration: 14 days
Observed: [14926 15184], Expected: [15055.0, 15055.0]
Average control conversion: 0.0953, Average treatment conversion: 0.106691

## Validity Test - SRM Test (Sample Ratio Mismatch)
H0: The ratio of samples is 1:1.
H1: The ratio of samples is not 1:1.
SRM significance level: 0.05, SRM p-value: 0.137
SRM validation: Fail to reject H0. No mismatch in the distribution of samples between the control and treatment groups.

## Validity Test - Novelty Effect Test 
H0: There is no novelty effect.
H1: There is novelty effect.
Novelty significance level: 0.05, Novelty p-value: 0.628
Novelty Effect Test Validation: Fail to reject H0. There is no novelty effect. In other words, it asserts that any observed changes in the conversion rate (or other metrics of interest) over time are due to random chance rather than a genuine novelty effect. 

## AB Test Results 
H0: There is no difference in conversion between the control and treatment groups.
H1: There is difference in conversion between the control and treatment groups.
AB test significance level: 0.05, AB test p-value: 0.001
AB test validation: Reject H0 and conclude that there is statistical significance in the difference of conversion between two variables.

Absolute difference: 0.0114
Relative difference: 11.99%
Absolute difference CI: 0.0046 to 0.0182
Relative difference CI: 4.85% to 19.13%

## AB Test Conclusion 
During the test, we noticed a 11.99% boost in performance compared to the control group. This outcome was statistically significant, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 4.85% to 19.13%.
However, the lower bound of confidence interval 4.85% is smaller than the minimum detectable effect 10%. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the test is successful. We need to repeat the test with a larger sample size to ascertain whether the new test genuinely results in a 10% increase.
